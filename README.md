The project includes the following files:

* spkmeans.py -  python interface, includes the execution of the program.

* spkmeans.c - C interface, includes the functions that build the project's logic, also main function executes program's logic. 

* spkmeans.h - C header file, so we can use spkmeams.c functions in the C-API.

* spkmeansmodule.c - C-API, can use only spkmeans.c functions (besides built in c modules).

* setup.py - setup file.

* comp.sh - compilation script

* additional files - kmeans.c and kmeans.h for kmeans algorithm.
